# Semantic Brand Score - Basic Python Demo
The Semantic Brand Score (SBS) is a novel metric designed to assess the importance of one or more brands, in different contexts and whenever it is possible to analyze textual data, even big data. This page presents a Python demo to calculate the Semantic Brand Score (its most basic version).

The notebook with the demo code is in this GitHub repository, **[click here to see it](SBS_Basic_Demo.ipynb)**.

More detailed descriptions of the metric and of this code are available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/calculating-the-semantic-brand-score-with-python-3f94fb8372a6?source=friends_link&sk=7858477b306fb938a0c85893c160f06f) and on the metric website [semanticbrandscore.com](https://semanticbrandscore.com). 

[At this link](https://semanticbrandscore.com/demographs/graphs.html) you can find an example of a more complete dashboard of results.

## Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the SBS Demo script: networkx, pandas, csv, re, nltk, numpy, string, collections.
Keeping all the process in memory is not recommended for big data. Please also consider using more efficient modules for network analysis, such as [Graph Tool](https://graph-tool.skewed.de/).
